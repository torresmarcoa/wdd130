    <h2>Marco Antonio Torres Aceves</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone! My name is Marco. Nice to meet you all. I was born in Texcoco, Mexico, but I live in Tuxtla Gutierrez, Chiapas, Mexico. I have 23 years, and I'm single. I have been a member of the Church all my life. I served the mission in Mission Mexico Xapala, and returned three years ago.</p>
    <p>I am studying for a Bachelor's Degree in Applied Technology. I started my degree with a computer support certificate, then I decided to take a system administrator certificate, and now I am currently studying for a computer programming certificate. As you may see, I like technology. More specifically, I love computers and everything that has to do with computers, from supporting them to programming them. I also enjoy playing video games, reading books, writing, and learning about technological advances. </p>
    <p>What I love most about BYU-I is that we study both spiritual and secular things, not as separate subjects but as things that complement each other. I have learned that I can count on the help of the Lord in both spiritual, secular, and all the matters of my life</p>
